Bush dealt with a difficult opponent on Sunday.</p>
<p>The former leader of the free world was playing in a $200 buy-in no-limit Texas hold’em game when he was confronted with a player who went all in with pocket eights.</p>
<p>Bush called and revealed his own Aces, resulting in a double up for him. The President has been known to enjoy a game of poker, and this latest victory is sure to bring good publicity to the Wynn Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The casino has been in the news recently due to allegations against its owner, Steve Wynn. These allegations have yet to be proven, but they have already cost Wynn his job as CEO of the company.</p>
<h1 id="George-W-Bush-Plays-Poker-at-the-Wynn-Casino-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#George-W-Bush-Plays-Poker-at-the-Wynn-Casino-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="George W. Bush Plays Poker at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas"></a>George W. Bush Plays Poker at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas</h1><p>Former President George W. Bush was spotted playing poker at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bush was sitting at a table with several other players and appeared to be enjoying himself. He joked with casino staff and took occasional breaks to smoke cigars on the casino’s patio.</p>
<p>“It was great to see him out and about,” said Wynn employee Casey Hynes. “He seemed to be having a good time.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Bush has been seen gambling in Las Vegas. In fact, he is something of a regular at the Wynn Casino, often playing poker or blackjack.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that Bush is a very polite and respectful player, and they are happy to have him as a customer.</p>
<p>“He’s always very pleasant and well-mannered,” said Wynn Casino spokesperson Kari Kelley. “We’re glad he enjoys our casino.”</p>
<h1 id="Watch-President-George-Walker-Bush-Play-Poker-at-the-Wynn-Casino"><a href="#Watch-President-George-Walker-Bush-Play-Poker-at-the-Wynn-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Watch President George Walker Bush Play Poker at the Wynn Casino"></a>Watch President George Walker Bush Play Poker at the Wynn Casino</h1><p>President George Walker Bush was recently spotted playing poker at the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas. The former President was in town for a fundraiser for his brother, Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that President Bush has been seen playing poker. In fact, he is known to be a regular player, both in Las Vegas and at home in Texas. In an interview with ESPN in 2009, President Bush said that he loves the game because “it’s so darn challenging.”</p>
<p>President Bush is reportedly a good poker player, but he has also been known to lose big pots. In one instance, he lost $130,000 in a single hand while playing at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Despite his losses, President Bush seems to enjoy the game immensely. And why not? Poker is a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
<h1 id="President-George-W-Bush-Seen-Playing-Poker-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#President-George-W-Bush-Seen-Playing-Poker-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="President George W. Bush Seen Playing Poker in Las Vegas"></a>President George W. Bush Seen Playing Poker in Las Vegas</h1><p>A recent photo of President George W. Bush has set the internet afire with speculation after it was revealed that he was playing poker at a Las Vegas casino. The former President has been a regular at the gambling tables in the past, but this time his game of choice was no ordinary one - it was Texas Hold’em.</p>
<p>The photo, which was first posted on Twitter by user @MikeEllisPhoto, shows Bush sitting at a table in the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino, surrounded by stacks of chips and four other players. Ellis later told ABC News that he had taken the photo on Monday morning and that Bush appeared to be having a good time.</p>
<p>Texas Hold’em is one of the most popular forms of poker and is typically played with between two and 10 players. The object of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the seven cards that are dealt to each player - two from their own deck, and five from a shared community deck.</p>
<p>Bush has been photographed playing poker before, including in 2013 when he was caught on camera playing at a charity event in Washington D.C. However, this latest snapshot has attracted more attention as it appears to show him taking part in a high-stakes game at a major casino.</p>
<p>The former President is known for being an avid gambler and has admitted to losing thousands of dollars while playing blackjack in Atlantic City. In fact, Bush even wrote about his love for gambling in his 2004 autobiography Decision Points, where he recalled losing $1,000 during a single night at the craps table.</p>
<p>“Gambling is an addiction I’ve learned to deal with,” Bush wrote. “I don’t like to lose - I’m competitive by nature - but I can handle it.”</p>
<p>Bush isn’t the only President to enjoy a bit of gambling - both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were known to enjoy playing poker in their downtime. And while it’s not illegal for U.S. Presidents to gamble, they are banned from entering casinos while in office. This probably won’t be much of an issue for Bush though, as he left office back in 2009.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Poker-Like-President-George-Walker-Bush"><a href="#How-to-Play-Poker-Like-President-George-Walker-Bush" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Poker Like President George Walker Bush"></a>How to Play Poker Like President George Walker Bush</h1><p>President George Walker Bush is a man of many talents. While most people only know him as the 43rd President of the United States, he is also an accomplished business executive, painter, and outdoorsman. One lesser-known hobby of President Bush’s is playing poker.</p>
<p>Back in 1986, George W. Bush won the Texas No-Limit Hold’em Poker Championship. His victory qualified him for the World Series of Poker, which he then went on to win in 1992. So if there’s anyone who knows how to play poker, it’s George W. Bush!</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to learn some of the president’s best tips for how to play poker like George W. Bush himself. Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="1-Don’t-Play-Too-Many-Hands"><a href="#1-Don’t-Play-Too-Many-Hands" class="headerlink" title="1: Don’t Play Too Many Hands"></a>1: Don’t Play Too Many Hands</h1><p>One of the biggest mistakes that novice poker players make is playing too many hands. When you play too many hands, you increase your chances of making a mistake and losing money.</p>
<p>As President Bush says, “The key to successful gambling is knowing when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. If you don’t have a good hand, fold—don’t force the issue just because you want to bet!”</p>
<p>Remember: folding is not a bad thing! It’s better to fold a bad hand than risk losing even more money by playing it out. As President Bush says, “If you can’t spot the sucker at the table, then you ARE the sucker!”</p>
<h1 id="2-Bet-Smartly-amp-Conservatively"><a href="#2-Bet-Smartly-amp-Conservatively" class="headerlink" title="2: Bet Smartly &amp; Conservatively"></a>2: Bet Smartly &amp; Conservatively</h1><p>When you do have a good hand, it’s important to bet smartly and conservatively. In other words, don’t risk too much money on one hand. As President Bush says, “A little bit of money goes a long way in poker.”</p>
<p>By betting smartly and conservatively, you’ll ensure that you’re not putting all your eggs in one basket—and that you’ll still be in the game even if you don’t win every hand. This is an important strategy to remember if you want to make money playing poker over time.</p>
<h1 id="3-Ante-Up-With-Confidence"><a href="#3-Ante-Up-With-Confidence" class="headerlink" title="3: Ante Up With Confidence"></a>3: Ante Up With Confidence</h1><p>Another important thing to remember when playing poker is to always ante up with confidence! When you’re sitting at the table with a good hand, act like you’re going to win—even if deep down inside you know that your chances aren’t great. Acting confident will intimidate your opponents and may cause them to fold prematurely.</p>
<p>As President Bush says, “Actions speak louder than words—so let your actions speak confidence!”</p>
