        <h1 id="PokerStars-Full-Tilt-Poker-and-888Poker-Included-in-Online-Poker-Tracker-4"><a href="#PokerStars-Full-Tilt-Poker-and-888Poker-Included-in-Online-Poker-Tracker-4" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and 888Poker Included in Online Poker Tracker 4"></a>PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and 888Poker Included in Online Poker Tracker 4</h1><p>On March 1, 2018, the team at PokerTrackerannounced the release of version 4 of its popular online poker tracking software. The new version includes a host of features and updates, including support for three of the largest poker sites in the world: PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and 888Poker.</p>
<p>“This is by far our biggest update ever,” said PokersTracker CEO Noah Schwartz, “and we’re really excited to offer our users the best possible experience when they’re playing online.”</p>
<p>The new version 4 of PokerTracker offers a host of features and updates, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and 888Poker</li>
<li>A completely redesigned HUD that provides players with more information than ever before * A new “Player Analyzer” that helps players to identify areas in which they can improve their game * A revamped “Table Scanner” that makes finding games faster and easier than ever before * Improved stability and performance across all platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above features, PokerTracker 4 also includes updates to its tracking for cash games, Sit &amp; Gos and tournaments. Players can now track even more data than ever before, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their game.</p>
<p>The release of PokerTracker 4 comes at a time of growth and expansion for the company. In recent years, PokerTracker has seen its user base grow exponentially, with over 500,000 active users worldwide. The company has also expanded its operations into new markets, including Brazil and Mexico.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to help players improve their game so that they can beat the competition,” said Schwartz. “With Version 4 of PokerTracker we continue to lead the way in providing our users with the most comprehensive toolset available.”</p>
<h1 id="Import-Hands-from-Multiple-Poker-Sites-with-Online-Poker-Tracker-4"><a href="#Import-Hands-from-Multiple-Poker-Sites-with-Online-Poker-Tracker-4" class="headerlink" title="Import Hands from Multiple Poker Sites with Online Poker Tracker 4"></a>Import Hands from Multiple Poker Sites with Online Poker Tracker 4</h1><p>Online Poker Tracker 4 (O.P.T. 4) is a comprehensive tracking and analysis software for Texas Hold’em cash games that allows users to import hands from multiple poker sites. O.P.T. 4 offers a variety of features and tools to help players improve their games, including detailed statistics on opponents’ playing styles, graphs and charts to visualize results, and customizable filters and reports.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful features of O.P.T. 4 is its ability to import hands from multiple poker sites into a single database for analysis. This allows players to track their progress over time and see how they perform against different types of opponents across different sites. O.P.T. 4 can automatically import hands from supported sites as soon as they become available, so there is no need to manually enter or export hands from different accounts.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this feature, first make sure that your poker site supports hand exports in the O.P.T 4 format (most do). Then open O.P.T 4 and click “ Tools &gt; Options &gt; Sites .” In the “Site 1” tab, select your preferred site from the “Import Site From” drop-down menu and enter your login credentials. Click “Save &amp; Close” to save your changes.</p>
<p>Now switch to the “Hands” tab and select the site you want to import hands from in the “Import Site” drop-down menu at the top of the screen (default is set to your current site). The hands for that site will be imported into O.P.T 4 and will be accessible in all tabs (e.g., Statistics, Graphs, Reports, etc.).</p>
<p>Oftentimes when grinding away at a particular form of poker it is useful to be able to occasionally take a step back and view things in a more global sense; what better way than importing all data possible into one software? And OPT4 makes doing this about as painless as it could possibly be – we’re not even talking about anything beyond clicking two buttons here people! If you haven’t tried it already we emphatically suggest doing so now if you’re reading this article; there’s really no reason not to given how affordable OPTA subscription has become ($6&#x2F;month!).</p>
