# How to break into mills 5 cent qt slot machines: Rowan Atkinson style

## Introduction

In the late 80s, Rowan Atkinson was a regular at casinos in Europe, where he would use a technique known as "the break" to win large sums of money from slot machines. This guide will teach you how to do the same.

Note that this technique is not allowed in most jurisdictions and you may be prosecuted if caught. Use it at your own risk.

## The break

The break is a simple but effective technique that can be used to beat Mills 5 cent qt slot machines. It involves triggering the machine's payout mechanism while the reels are still spinning, so that you get your money back before the machine has time to reset itself.

To do the break, all you need is a coin and some timing skills. First, insert the coin into the machine and wait for the reels to start spinning. As soon as they begin spinning, hit the payout button and quickly remove the coin. If done correctly, you should hear the machine's payout sound effect and see your money being dispensed. If not, try again until you get it right.

The key is to hit the payout button at exactly the right moment - too early or too late and you'll lose your money! There's no exact science to it, but with a bit of practice you'll be able to do it every time.

# How to cheat at mills 5 cent qt slot machines: Rowan Atkinson tricks!

The popular "Mills 5 cent qt" slot machines can be beaten by using a few simple techniques demonstrated by the hilarious Rowan Atkinson in the classic comedy movie "Johnny English".

First, insert your coins and pull the lever to start the game. Wait for the reels to stop spinning, and then study which symbols are shown. Note down which symbols are shown on each reel, as this information will be needed later.

Now, press the button to spin the reels again. This time, however, do not watch the reels spin - instead, look away and concentrate on your note-taking. When the reels have finished spinning, quickly look at your notes to see which symbol is now showing on each reel.

If you followed my instructions correctly, you'll now know which symbol is most likely to show up on each reel next. So, based on this information, you can now start betting more money on certain combinations of symbols that are likely to appear next.

For example, if you know that the symbol of a lion is showing on reel 1, then you should bet more money on combinations that include that symbol appearing on reel 2 or 3 next. Likewise, if the symbol of a duck is showing on reel 3, then you should bet more money on combinations that include that symbol appearing on reel 4 or 5 next.

It's important to note that these techniques won't always work - but when they do, they can be used to win big payouts from the Mills 5 cent qt slot machines! Give them a try the next time you're playing and see if you can beat the odds!
