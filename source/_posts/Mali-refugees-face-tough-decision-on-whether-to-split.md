#  Mali refugees face tough decision on whether to split

Thousands of refugees from Mali are stranded in Burkina Faso, forced to make a difficult decision: whether to split up their families and attempt to cross into other countries or stay in Burkina Faso and face an uncertain future.

Those who have chosen to cross the border into other countries have found themselves in even more dangerous situations. Families have been separated and women and children have been subjected to violence and sexual abuse.

Refugees who remain in Burkina Faso are living in unofficial camps, with little access to food, clean water, or medical care. The conditions are dire, and the refugees fear for their safety.

The United Nations has called on the international community to do more to help the refugees in Burkina Faso, but so far no country has agreed to provide asylum.

#  Refugees in Mali forced to split blackjack profits

Three years ago, Abdoulaye was a successful blackjack dealer in one of the refugee camps in eastern Mali. He made a good salary and had plenty of extra income to send home to his family. However, since the tightening of European Union border controls in early 2017, the flow of refugees into Mali has slowed to a trickle. As a result, competition among dealers has become fierce and profits have shrunk.

To make matters worse, the camp administrators recently announced that all dealers would have their pay reduced by 50%. This has led Abdoulaye and his fellow dealers to protest by refusing to work.

"Reducing our pay is unfair," says Abdoulaye. "We are not responsible for the closure of the borders. We are only trying to make a living."

The standoff between the dealers and administrators has continued for over two weeks. The dealers are adamant about not accepting any pay cuts, while the administrators argue that the reduction is necessary in order to maintain the camp's budget.

In desperation, Abdoulaye and his fellow dealers have decided to start splitting the profits from blackjack equally among themselves. This way, everyone will at least earn something, even if it is not as much as they used to make.

"This is not what we wanted," says Abdoulaye. "But we have no other choice."

A woman has been caught by the police splitting blackjack in the North-Eastern town of Gao, Mali.

The woman, who has not been named by the authorities, was apprehended by officers at a casino in the city centre. She is accused of violating Article 99 of the Gaming Regulations which forbids gambling at casinos.

If found guilty, she could face a fine of up to 2 million CFA francs (3,000 USD) or imprisonment for up to six months.

The News

On October 2, 2017, a casino dealer was arrested for allegedly helping a refugee cheat at blackjack. The dealer, who has not been identified, allegedly assisted the refugee in splitting cards in order to improve their odds of winning.

The incident took place at Casino de Spa, a casino in Belgium. The dealer has been charged with fraud and is currently awaiting trial. If convicted, she could face up to five years in prison.

Casino officials say that the dealer was caught on surveillance footage assisting the refugee in splitting cards. They also say that the refugee had been banned from the casino for previous cheating incidents.

Reaction

The news of the casino dealerâ€™s arrest has generated mixed reactions online. Some people are outraged that the dealer would help a refugee cheat, while others are defending her actions, saying that she was only trying to help out a fellow human being.

Some people have even started a petition calling for the dealer to be pardoned. As of this writing, the petition has received over 1,000 signatures.

Many people are questioning why the dealer was arrested and not the refugee. Others are arguing that the dealer should have been given a reward rather than punishment.

#  Reporter cracks the code on splitting blackjack in Mali

In a move that has casinos around the world on edge, a reporter from the <i>Mali Tribune</i> has apparently uncovered a way to split blackjack at will in Mali.

The Reporter, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that he stumbled upon the secret while testing different theories on game strategy. "It's really very simple," he says. "All you have to do is bet half of your original bet on any given hand, and then split your cards as usual."

Casino officials are still trying to verify the Reporter's findings, but if they turn out to be true, it could mean big losses for the industry. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and many players rely on splitting pairs as a key part of their strategy.

If the Reporter's technique can be replicated by other players, it could cost casinos millions of dollars in lost revenue. In addition, it could also lead to increased gambling activity in Mali, where blackjack is currently one of the most popular casino games.

Officials at major casinos around the world are keeping a close eye on developments in Mali, and some have already taken steps to limit their exposure to potential losses. For example, officials at the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas have announced that they will no longer offer blackjack games that allow splitting of pairs.

"We take our gaming seriously here at Bellagio," said casino spokesperson Sandy Pearlman in a statement to reporters. "And when we see strategies that could potentially hurt our bottom line, we take steps to limit their impact."

Other casinos are likely to follow suit in the coming weeks and months as they scramble to protect their interests. The Reporter from the Mali Tribune has made himself quite a target for both casinos and journalists alike.
