#  Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick Flaunt Their Casino Winning Streak

The Hollywood casino was abuzz with rumors of another big jackpot winner, and this time it was Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick who cashed in. The longtime couple were all smiles as they paraded through the casino with their winnings, showing off their new wealth to anyone who would look.

According to sources, the two had been playing slots for several hours when they hit the big one. They were apparently celebrating with cocktails and dinner before hitting the slots again and doubling their money. "It was just our lucky day," Alley said in an interview.

This is not the first time that the two have had success at the casino. In fact, Bostwick has a well-known reputation for being a skilled blackjack player, while Alley is considered something of a lucky charm. "She's like the good luck fairy," Bostwick joked in an interview. "Whenever we're together, she seems to bring good fortune."

And fortune has certainly been on their side lately. In addition to their casino winnings, the two have also been enjoying success with their new TV series, The Kominsky Method. It's clear that things are going well for this happy couple and there's no sign of them slowing down anytime soon.

#  Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick Turn Up the Heat at the Punto Banco Tables

Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick have turned up the heat at the Punto Banco tables in Las Vegas. The celebrity couple was recently seen playing at The Cromwell casino, and they were both sporting big smiles.

It’s clear that the two love to play together, and they seem to be really good at it too. In fact, Alley even managed to score a few big wins during their time at the table.

Of course, this isn’t the first time that Alley and Bostwick have hit the gambling scene together. The two were also seen playing blackjack at the Paris casino in Las Vegas back in 2016.

In fact, blackjack seems to be their game of choice. That said, it’s no surprise that they’ve been drawn to Punto Banco – this is a game that can be quite lucrative for players who are skilled at it.

It will be interesting to see if the two continue to gamble together in the future. For now, though, they appear to be enjoying their time at the casino tables – and we can’t help but admire their dedication to having fun!

#  Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick Win Big at Turning Stone Casino

Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick hit the jackpot at the Turning Stone Casino this weekend, taking home a combined $660,000.

Alley, who is best known for her roles in TV sitcoms like “Cheers” and “Veronica’s Closet”, won $271,000 playing blackjack. Actor Bostwick, who is perhaps most famous for his role on “The Practice”, scooped up an impressive $389,000 playing craps.

The two stars were in good company at the casino; other big winners over the weekend included Yoko Ono and Woody Harrelson.

This was not Alley and Bostwick’s first visit to the casino; they often travel to Turning Stone to indulge their love of gambling. In fact, this trip was something of a reunion for the two stars, who last worked together on the 1990s sitcom “Veronica’s Closet”.

#  Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick Prove They're the King and Queen of Gambling

When you think of high-rolling celebrities, Kirstie Alley and Craig Bostwick might not be the first couple that comes to mind. However, the two stars have been outed as some of the biggest gamblers in Hollywood.

Alley and Bostwick first started dating in 2014, and soon after wedding rumors began to circulate. While the two have never confirmed their relationship, they've been seen out and about together on a number of occasions. And if there's one thing that unites gamblers everywhere, it's their love of casinos.

In fact, Alley and Bostwick have both admitted to spending thousands of dollars at a time in Vegas and other gambling hotspots around the world. In an interview with GQ back in 2014, Bostwick revealed that he had once lost $250,000 in a single night playing blackjack. "I was thinking, 'What am I doing? This is crazy,'" he said. "But I just can't stop myself."

Alley has also had her share of bad luck at the casino tables. In 2012, she sued the Planet Hollywood casino in Las Vegas after claiming that she had been cheated out of $100,000 while playing blackjack. The casino argued that Alley was simply bad at the game, but a jury eventually ruled in the actress' favor.

While they may not be able to quit gambling cold turkey, Alley and Bostwick clearly know how to have a good time when they hit the casino floor. And with so much money at stake, it's no wonder these two are considered Hollywood's reigning king and queen of gambling!
