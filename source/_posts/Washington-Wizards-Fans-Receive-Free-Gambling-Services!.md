#  Washington Wizards Fans Receive Free Gambling Services!

Yesterday, the Washington Wizards announced that all of their fans would be receiving free access to a gambling service. This is a great move by the team, as it will give their fans a way to make some money on games.

The service that the Wizards are providing is called “Wizards Wager”. It is a new product that is being offered by the team’s official betting partner, PointsBet. With this service, fans will be able to place bets on all kinds of things related to the Wizards. This includes games, players, and even outcomes of individual matchups.

The Wizards are not the only team in the NBA that is providing this type of service to its fans. The Golden State Warriors also offer a similar product called “Warriors Playbook”. This service allows fans to bet on things like how many three pointers Stephen Curry will make in a game, or what the final score of a game will be.

It is no secret that gambling can be addictive. However, teams like the Warriors and Wizards are hoping that their free gambling services will keep people engaged with their team and help to build excitement around their games.

#  Washington Wizards Gamblers Win Big by Calling 1-877-898-1117!

The Washington Wizards are not a team that is typically known for their gambling skills. In fact, they are often considered to be one of the weaker teams in the NBA. Recently, however, they have managed to pull off an amazing gambling win, thanks to a well-timed call to 1-877-898-1117.

The Wizards were matched up against the Brooklyn Nets in a game that was predicted to be very close. With only seconds left on the clock, it looked as though the Nets were going to come away with the win. That is until Washington's Otto Porter hit a three pointer that gave them the lead and eventual victory.

So how did the Wizards manage to pull off this upset? It turns out that they had called 1-877-898-1117 for some last minute gambling advice. This number is operated by none other than The Wizard of Odds himself, Michael Shackleford.

Shackleford is a world-renowned gambling expert who has been quoted in many major newspapers and magazines. He has also appeared as a guest expert on several TV shows, including Good Morning America and The Today Show. When it comes to gambling, there is nobody more knowledgeable than Michael Shackleford.

So what advice did Shackleford give the Washington Wizards before their big game? According to him, they should focus on taking advantage of the Nets' weaknesses. Specifically, he advised them to bet on the OVER/UNDER of 204 points and to bet on the Brooklyn Nets +7 points.

These bets ended up being very successful, as both of them won outright. This gave the Wizards a much needed upset victory and proved that when it comes to gambling, they can definitely hold their own against the best of them.
