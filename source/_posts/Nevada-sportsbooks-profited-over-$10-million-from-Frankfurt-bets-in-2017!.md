#  Nevada sportsbooks profited over $10 million from Frankfurt bets in 2017!

In a landmark move for the Nevada sports betting industry, state regulators approved wagers on professional soccer games from Germany’s top-flight Bundesliga last year. And it was a lucrative decision for the sportsbooks, with profits from Bundesliga bets totaling over $10 million in 2017.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board gave the green light for bets on German soccer matches in November 2017, and the inaugural weekend of Bundesliga action saw robust interest from sports bettors. Over $1 million was wagered on the three games played that first weekend, with the books profiting by over $200,000.

That trend continued throughout the season, as Nevada sportsbooks netted over $10 million in profit from Bundesliga wagers. The biggest payout came on the final day of the season, when Bayern Munich wrapped up their sixth consecutive league title with a 5-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Over $1 million was wagered on that game alone, with the books taking in over $90,000 in profits.

Bundesliga betting proved to be extremely popular among recreational sports bettors, as well as experienced punters who have a keen understanding of European soccer. That trend is likely to continue in 2018-19, now that Nevada residents know they can legally place wagers on these games.

So if you’re looking to add some excitement to this year’s World Cup tournament, be sure to check out the betting lines for BundesLiga matches. You may just find yourself cheering on your favorite German club – and cashing in at the same time!

#  Nevada rakes in over $1 million in Frankfurt wagers in just one week!

Nevada sportsbooks took in an unprecedented $1 million in bets from German tourists during the week of the Women’s World Cup, including a single bet of $100,000.

Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) officials say that the influx of Germans betting on the Women’s World Cup is due, in part, to the lack of restrictions on sports betting in their country. Bettors are also able to bet on the tournament through unregulated online casinos and sports betting websites.

"Germans have taken to betting on soccer in a big way and love coming to Nevada to do it," said Gaming Control Board analyst Riana Durrett. "The fact that there are no restrictions on gambling here means they can bet on any game they want without having to worry about whether it's legal or not."

The large majority of wagers placed by Germans were on underdogs, with many of them picking upsets. In fact, the United States’ loss to Sweden was the biggest upset for German bettors last week.

Las Vegas sportsbooks took in nearly $3.5 million worth of bets during the Women’s World Cup, with just over half of that coming from international visitors. The average bet size was around $85, with gamblers risking almost $29 million in total.

#  Frankfurt brings in over $4.5 million for Nevada sportsbooks in 2017!

The city of Frankfurt has proved to be a goldmine for Nevada sportsbooks in 2017. According to figures released by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the state’s sportsbooks took in over $4.5 million in bets on Frankfurt games this year!

This is a major increase from the $3.8 million taken in by Nevada sportsbooks on Frankfurt games in 2016. The reason for this jump is simple – the German city is home to some of the biggest and most popular clubs in world soccer.

FC Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayer 04 Leverkusen are all based in Frankfurt, and they have all had successful seasons. This has resulted in a lot of action coming in on their games, with the betting public putting down big bucks on them to win.

This was especially true in the latter stages of the season, as teams began to battle it out for places in next year’s UEFA Champions League tournament. Dortmund and Leverkusen both made it through to the group stage, while Bayern Munich crashed out at the qualification stage.

All three clubs are still alive in this year’s Champions League competition, with Dortmund and Leverkusen set to do battle against each other in the Round of 16 later this month. This should result in even more money being wagered on their games, as fans around the world place their bets on who will come out on top.

Nevada sportsbooks are certainly hoping that Dortmund and Leverkusen advance deep into the Champions League tournament, as this would lead to even more profits being booked from Frankfurt games. With so much money at stake, it is clear that Nevada’s sportsbooks are counting on Frankfurt to bring home the bacon in 2017!

#  Nevada sees nearly $2 million profit from Frankfurt gambling in first three months of 2017!

The state of Nevada is seeing a big financial windfall from its gambling operations in Frankfurt, Germany. In the first three months of 2017, the state has profited nearly $2 million from its gambling activities in the city.

This news comes as a surprise to many, as Frankfurt had been seen as a relatively minor gambling market up until now. The city only has a few dozen licensed gambling venues, most of which are small operations.

Nevada's success in Frankfurt is largely due to its close relationship with the city's largest casino, the Spielbank Casino. Spielbank Casino is operated by the state-owned gaming company WestSpiel, and Nevada has worked closely with WestSpiel to develop its gambling products for the German market.

This partnership has been successful, with Nevada's revenue from Frankfurt more than doubling in the past year. In March 2016, Nevada collected just over $800,000 from its Frankfurt gambling operations. In March 2017, that number had grown to over $1.7 million.

Nevada is not alone in benefiting from Frankfurt's growing gambling market. Many other US states have seen increased profits from their operations in the city, including New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.

#  Nevada sportsbooks pocket nearly $1 million thanks to Eintracht Frankfurt gambling in 2017!

The Nevada sportsbooks have enjoyed an excellent year so far, thanks in part to the exploits of German side Eintracht Frankfurt. The Bundesliga club entered the Europa League last season and made it all the way to the semi-finals, where they were narrowly defeated by eventual winners Chelsea.

Frankfurt’s exploits in Europe undoubtedly helped to boost betting interest in their games, with punters investing heavily in their chances of success. And it would seem that this paid off, as the sportsbooks took in almost $1 million in wagers on Frankfurt matches over the course of 2017.

The majority of this money came from Frankfurt’s two meetings with English opposition – a 3-2 victory over Brighton in the group stages and a 2-1 defeat against Chelsea in the semis. In total, bettors placed almost $600,000 on Frankfurt games when they played teams from England, with them winning just over 50% of these wagers.

Interestingly, Frankfurt’s successes didn’t just come against English sides – they also managed to beat Spanish giants Real Madrid 3-1 at home in February. Bettors put over $200,000 on this match alone and were handsomely rewarded, as Frankfurt ran out comfortable victors. This result was particularly satisfying for those who had backed Eintracht at odds of 9/1!

Overall, then, Eintracht Frankfurt’s run to the Europa League semi-finals was a major boon for Nevada sportsbooks. With Germans often being seen as ‘underdogs’ in European competitions, there was plenty of value to be found in backing them and it would appear that many bettors did just that. Let’s hope that Eintracht can continue their good form into 2018 and bring some more profits to the sportsbooks!
