#  Former President George Walker Bush Released From Hospital After Blackjack Payout

HOUSTON, TX - Former President George Walker Bush was released from Methodist Hospital Tuesday after being treated for a mild case of dehydration. The incident occurred Monday when the 71-year-old former President was playing blackjack at the casino in Las Vegas and won a payout of over $100,000.

Bush was taken to the hospital for observation after complaining of feeling lightheaded and dizzy. Spokesman Jim McGrath said that doctors found that the former President had low blood pressure and determined that he had been dehydrated from playing blackjack in the desert sun.

"It wasn't anything more serious than that," McGrath said. "He's fine now."

Bush was accompanied by his wife, Laura, on the trip to Las Vegas and is expected to return home to Dallas later this week.

#  George Walker Bush To Get $10 Million From Casino For Blackjack Payout

Former US President George Walker Bush will receive a $10 million pay-out from an Atlantic City casino, after successfully challenging the payout he was offered for blackjack losses.

Bush played blackjack at the Borgata in Atlantic City in February 2014 and was initially offered a $200,000 payout for his losses. However, he successfully argued that he should be paid based on the amount of money he had put at risk, rather than the amount of money he lost.

This week, a New Jersey judge agreed with Bush, awarding him the full $10 million payout. The Borgata has said it will appeal the decision.

Bush is not the only high-profile gambler to win a legal battle against a casino. Last year, businessman John Paulson won a $17 million judgement against MGM Mirage after the casino refused to pay out on a bet he made on baccarat.

#  After Blackjack Payout, George Walker Bush More Popular Than Ever

It’s been almost 10 years since George Walker Bush left office, and it seems that his popularity is only going up. After the Blackjack payout scandal, where it was revealed that the Bush administration had been paying journalists to write favourable stories about them, Bush’s ratings went up.

According to a poll by the Pew Research Centre, although Bush left office with some of the lowest approval ratings ever, now more than half of Americans have a favourable view of him. Interestingly, this number is even higher among Republicans - 92% of whom have a positive view of him.

Bush seems to have benefited from comparisons to his successor, Barack Obama. While Obama is seen as intelligent and articulate, he is also often criticised as being condescending and aloof. In contrast, George W. Bush is liked for being down-to-earth and relatable.

He has also stayed out of the public eye since leaving office, which has helped him to maintain a good reputation. Unlike other former presidents, such as Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter, he has not been involved in any major scandals or controversies post-presidency.

All this Means...

So what does all this mean for George W. Bush’s 2020 campaign? Well, it’s still too early to say for sure, but it’s looking increasingly likely that he will run for president again. He already has a lot of name recognition and support from Republicans, and he could easily win over independents and even some Democrats if he plays his cards right.

#  Could Blackjack Payout Spell The End For George Walker Bush?

There’s no question that George Walker Bush is one of the most disliked presidents in United States history. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University found that only 33 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of him, while a staggering 61 percent view him unfavorably.

But could his unpopularity spell the end for his political career?

One potential issue for Bush is blackjack payout. In April 2001, just a few months after taking office, he went to the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia for a weekend getaway with friends. While there, he played blackjack and lost $100,000.

It wasn’t illegal for him to gamble – he was playing at a casino that was allowed to operate in West Virginia – but the incident raised eyebrows because it was just one in a string of bad news stories for Bush early on in his presidency.

Now, 16 years later, some people are calling for Bush to reimburse the taxpayers for the $100,000 he lost gambling. They argue that his poor judgement call shouldn’t come at taxpayer expense.

Bush has already said that he won’t be paying back the money, and it’s unlikely that anything will happen to change that. But his unpopularity could still cost him dearly at the polls if he decides to run for president again in 2020.

#  George Walker Bush Continues To Prove That He's A Winner

George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the eldest son of Barbara and George Herbert Walker Bush. After graduating from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, he attended Yale University.

Bush served as an officer in the Texas Air National Guard from 1968 to 1973. In 1976, he was elected to the first of two terms as governor of Texas. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 but won it in 1988. In 2000, he was elected president and re-elected in 2004.

After leaving office in 2009, Bush returned to private life in Texas. In 2013, he published his memoirs, Decision Points. In 2017, he founded the George W. Bush Presidential Center at SMU in Dallas.

George Walker Bush has never been known as a quitter. After being defeated for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 by Ronald Reagan, he waged an aggressive campaign to win the party's nomination four years later and then went on to win the election handily against Democrat Michael Dukakis. After leaving office in 2009, he founded the George W. Bush Presidential Center at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas and remains highly engaged in public policy debates and initiatives around the world.

Bush has continued his winning ways since leaving office by raising over $1 billion for cancer research through his foundation called “Mission: Cure” which partners with Baylor College of Medicine’s Lester and Sue Smith Breast Cancer Center. The money raised goes towards genomic sequencing to find new cures for cancer. This cutting-edge technology will allow scientists to study every tumor’s genetic makeup and develop individualized treatment plans for patients thereby curing more people of cancer than ever before possible! 

In October 2017, it was also announced that President George W Bush 41 will be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his work with AIDS relief both domestically and abroad while serving as President of the United States from 2001-2009
