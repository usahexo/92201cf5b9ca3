#  Who are the developers of the game?

The developers of the game are two people who go by the names "The Game Theorists." Matt and Ryan, both friends in college, bonded over their shared interest in gaming and decided to start making videos about it together. After a few years of making weekly videos and amassing a large following on YouTube, the two decided to take their talents to the next level and create a game.

The Game Theorists have since become known for their engaging and informative content, which has helped them garner over 10 million subscribers on YouTube. In addition to creating the game, they continue to produce weekly videos on gaming topics ranging from Mario Party secrets to suggesting new games for Nintendo Switch.
