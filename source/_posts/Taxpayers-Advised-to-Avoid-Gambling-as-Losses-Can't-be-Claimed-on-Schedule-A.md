#  Taxpayers Advised to Avoid Gambling as Losses Can't be Claimed on Schedule A

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has released a statement warning taxpayers against the dangers of gambling, as any losses cannot be claimed on their tax return.

“Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for individuals and families,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig in a statement. “We urge people to avoid gambling altogether and instead use that money to pay bills, invest in their education or retirement, or save for a rainy day.”

Gambling income is considered taxable by the federal government, but any losses cannot be claimed as a deduction on Schedule A. This applies whether you gamble at a casino, racetrack, or through other means such as poker or lottery tickets.

The only exception is if you gamble in connection with your business. For example, if you are a professional gambler or work in the casino industry, then your gambling losses may be deductible.

There are also state-level taxes on gambling income and losses, so it’s important to check with your local tax authority to see what rules apply in your area.

The bottom line is that gambling can be costly - both financially and emotionally - so it’s best to avoid it if possible. There are many other ways to have fun and enjoy yourself without risking your hard-earned money.

#  Gambling Losses Can't Be Deducted in Most Cases

In the United States, taxpayers are able to deduct gambling losses on their federal income tax returns only if they itemize their deductions. This means that if a taxpayer chooses to take the standard deduction instead of itemizing, they cannot deduct any of their gambling losses for the year.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, taxpayers can deduct their gambling losses if they can prove that the losses were more than their winnings. In addition, certain types of gambling activities qualify for the deduction, such as casino games, horseracing, and lotteries. However, most other forms of gambling do not qualify, including poker and sports betting.

Taxpayers who have incurred significant gambling losses in a given year may find that it is more advantageous to take the standard deduction instead of itemizing. This is because the standard deduction is a fixed amount that is not dependent on individual deductions, whereas itemized deductions are subject to phaseouts that can reduce or eliminate them altogether.

While gambling losses cannot be deducted in most cases, there are some exceptions. Taxpayers should speak with a tax professional to determine if they are eligible to deduct their losses.

#  Sorry, You Can't Deduct Those Gambling Losses


You lost money gambling last year. You were really hoping that you could deduct those losses on your taxes. Unfortunately, the IRS says that you can't. Here's why.

The IRS allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses only if they itemize their deductions. Most taxpayers, however, take the standard deduction instead of itemizing. Therefore, they can't deduct their gambling losses.

In order to deduct your losses, you must keep track of all of your gambling transactions during the year. This includes wins and losses. You must also have documentation to prove the amount of your losses.

If you do decide to itemize your deductions and claim your gambling losses, there are some limitations on how much you can deduct. You can only deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings for the year. So, if you won $500 but lost $1,000, you can only deduct $500 of your losses on your taxes.

The good news is that you can carry over any excess losses from one year to the next. So, if you have more than $500 in losses in a given year but less than $1,000 in winnings, you can still deduct $500 of those losses on your taxes. However, any unused losses cannot be carried over to future years.

The bottom line is that if you want to claim your gambling losses on your taxes, make sure to keep track of all of your transactions and have proof of the amount of those losses. And remember that only certain taxpayers are eligible to do this in the first place!
