#  Doors Open for Hampton Seaside Casino Ballroom Events!

The Hampton Seaside Casino Ballroom has been a popular destination for special events and weddings in the Hampton Roads area for many years. But recent upgrades have made it an even more attractive option, with new event spaces, a modern ballroom and more.

A recent open house showcased the renovations and allowed couples to see all that the ballroom has to offer. Upgrades include new event spaces including the Boardwalk Ballroom and Atlantic Ballroom, both of which offer stunning water views. The ballroom itself has been completely renovated, with a modern design that is perfect for any occasion.

And of course, the casino floor is still available for private parties and events. With over 650 slot machines and 25 table games, there is something for everyone. Plus, the casino floor can be partitioned off for smaller events or meetings.
