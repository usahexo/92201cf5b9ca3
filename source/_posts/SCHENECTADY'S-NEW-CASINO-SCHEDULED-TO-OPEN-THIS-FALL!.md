#  SCHENECTADY'S NEW CASINO SCHEDULED TO OPEN THIS FALL!

After months of anticipation and speculation, it has been confirmed that Proctors Casino will be opening its doors to the public this fall.

The casino, which is being touted as Schenectady's "new diamond in the rough", will offer a variety of gaming options, including blackjack, craps, roulette and slot machines. In addition to traditional casino games, there will also be a bar and restaurant on site, as well as a concert hall that can accommodate up to 2,000 people.

According to developers, the goal of Proctors Casino is to create an entertainment destination that will rival any other in the area. They are confident that the combination of gaming, dining and live entertainment options will be enough to draw people from all over the region.

The casino is expected to create approximately 350 jobs, most of which will be full-time positions. Developer John Carver is hopeful that the casino will also have a positive effect on the city's economy, stating that "Proctors Casino represents a significant investment in Schenectady's future. We believe it will not only create new jobs and economic opportunities but also help to attract new businesses and residents to our community."

Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy couldn't agree more, adding "This is great news for our city. The casino will generate much-needed revenue for our schools and local businesses, and it will also create jobs and bring new life to our downtown district."

#  CAN't WAIT FOR SCHENECTADY'S NEW CASINO TO OPEN?

If you're like most people in the Capital Region, you're eagerly awaiting the opening of Schenectady's new casino. Governor Cuomo made the much anticipated announcement in early 2018, and since then, excitement has been building for the new facility.

What will the casino be like?

The new casino will be significantly larger than any of the other gambling venues in upstate New York. It will feature 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games. In addition, there will be a variety of restaurants and bars, as well as a hotel with 250 rooms.

Who can gamble at the casino?

The casino will be open to anyone over 21 years of age who is physically present in the state of New York. Players will need to present a government-issued photo ID in order to gain access to the gaming floor.

What are some of the benefits of the new casino?

The Schenectady casino is expected to generate $300 million in revenue each year, which will be used to support education and infrastructure projects throughout the state. In addition, the facility will create 1400 jobs, providing much-needed employment opportunities in Schenectady and its surrounding communities. Finally, the casino is expected to attract visitors from all over upstate New York, generating millions of dollars in tourism revenue.

When is it scheduled to open?

The exact opening date has not yet been announced, but it is expected that the casino will be operational by the end of 2018.

#  SChenectady's new casino opening this fall – watch out Vegas!

Looking to put Schenectady on the map, the new Rivers Casino and Resort is scheduled to open this fall. With gambling, restaurants and a hotel, the $330 million facility is hoping to bring in tourists from Buffalo, Albany and beyond.

The casino is currently under construction next to Mohawk Harbor – an apartment, retail and business development on the Mohawk River. The location couldn't be more perfect, nestled in between two of New York's major metropolitan areas.

The casino will feature a 125,000-square-foot gaming floor with 1,150 slot machines and 63 table games. There will also be a 20,000-square-foot IMAX theater, as well as five restaurants and a steakhouse. A 120-room hotel is also in the works.

This isn't Rivers Casino's first rodeo. The company already operates casinos in Pittsburgh, Des Plaines, Illinois and Philadelphia. But this will be the company's largest casino yet.

Casinos have been known to boost tourism in the areas where they're located and often bring in much needed revenue for cash-strapped municipalities. In addition to creating jobs, casinos can also generate money for schools and other community services.

So what does this mean for Vegas?

Well, it's not exactly clear yet what kind of impact Rivers Casino will have on Sin City's gambling industry but it's safe to say that competition is heating up. MGM Resorts International recently opened a $1.4 billion resort casino in Springfield, Massachusetts – just an hour north of Hartford – and there are already plans for another casino in Boston.

It'll be interesting to see how things play out this fall when both casinos open their doors. Will people make the trip to Schenectady instead of Vegas? Only time will tell…

#  ready or not, schenectadys new casino is scheduled to open in october!

After years of delays and false starts, the $330 million Rivers Casino & Resort in Schenectady is on track to open in October.

The 43-acre development will feature a 125,000-square-foot casino with more than 1,800 slot machines and 50 table games, as well as a hotel, restaurants, an event center and other amenities.

It will create about 1,200 jobs and has already spawned several new businesses in the citys Stockade district.

Rivers Casino was originally scheduled to open in the summer of 2016, but construction delays pushed back the opening. Then the company that was supposed to supply table games went bankrupt, further delaying things.

In January, Rush Street Gaming, which owns Rivers Casino, reached an agreement with New York state to take over operations of Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway. That agreement allowed Rivers to open its slots operation earlier this year.

Now all that remains is getting the final approvals from the State Gaming Commission, which is expected to happen in August.
