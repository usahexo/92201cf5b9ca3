#  Why is sports betting against the Blazers so popular?

Portland Trail Blazers is one of the most popular NBA teams. Facing them is always a challenge for the opponents, and their fans are among the most loyal ones. So it’s no wonder that sports betting against the Blazers is so popular.

Some people may say that it’s because of their bad luck. But if we take a closer look at their history, we can easily see that they have always had an interesting, unpredictable and thrilling style of play. They never give up and always fight until the end.

And that’s why sports betting against them is so popular – because they are always a real threat to their opponents, no matter who they are.

Do people root for the underdog?

There are many possible reasons why people might root for the underdog, and no one answer is right for everyone. Some might find satisfaction in seeing the little guy win, while others may admire the underdog's tenacity in continuing to fight even when the odds seem stacked against them. Whatever the reason, there's no doubt that rooting for the underdog is a popular choice.

One of the most famous examples of rooting for the underdog is the story of David and Goliath. In this story from the Bible, David, a young shepherd boy, faces off against Goliath, a giant Philistine warrior. Despite being heavily outnumbered, David beats Goliath using only a slingshot and a stone. This story has captured people's imaginations for centuries and continues to be popular today.

Another example of an underdog story that resonates with people is The Karate Kid. In this movie, Daniel LaRusso moves to California and finds himself bullied by members of the local karate dojo. He eventually befriends Mr. Miyagi, who teaches him karate and helps him fight back against his bullies. Daniel ultimately defeats them in a tournament, proving that he is worthy of respect. This story teaches viewers that hard work and determination can overcome any obstacle.

While not all underdogs are successful in their pursuits, their stories often inspire people to pursue their own dreams with greater vigor. We admire underdogs for their courage in the face of adversity and their unwillingness to give up despite being at a disadvantage. So next time you're watching a sporting event or movie, keep your eye on the underdog - you may just find yourself rooting for them too

#  Do people think they're not going to do well this year?

It's the middle of January, which means it's time for our annual review of resolutions. How are people doing on their goals from last year? Have they given up yet?

In a survey by Bankrate, only 8% of respondents said they expected to achieve all of their 2018 resolutions. 42% percent said they expected to achieve some of their resolutions, while 47% said they would probably not achieve any of their resolutions. So it seems that many people think they're not going to do well this year.

There are many reasons why people might not achieve their resolutions. Maybe they don't have the necessary skills or knowledge to accomplish them. Maybe they're not motivated enough or they're struggling with temptation. Or maybe they set unrealistic goals for themselves.

Whatever the reason, it's important to remember that failure is not permanent. If you don't achieve your resolution this year, don't give up – try again next year! There are plenty of resources out there to help you, including books, articles, and online courses. And if you still can't seem to make progress, consider seeking out professional help.

So don't be discouraged if you're struggling with your resolutions – there's always hope for the future! Just keep working hard and never give up on your dreams.

#  Is there something about their team that makes them less likely to win?

In any sport, there are always teams that are considered to be stronger than others. This is evident in the Las Vegas odds, where people can place bets on the outcome of a game or tournament. In any given year, there are usually one or two teams that everyone expects to win, while there are other teams that are seen as longshots.

This year, it seems that the Golden State Warriors are the team to beat. They have the best record in the NBA, and they are considered by many to be the favorites to win the championship. However, there is always room for doubt. There is something about their team that makes them less likely to win.

The Warriors have been very impressive this season, but they have also been fortunate. They have had an easy schedule, and they have not faced many tough opponents. When they do play against a good team, they often struggle. This was evident in their most recent game against the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs were able to beat the Warriors by a score of 111-86.

This loss showed that the Warriors are not invincible. They may be the best team in the NBA right now, but they are not unbeatable. There are other teams out there that can challenge them and potentially win against them.

## Portland's Been Slumping

It's no secret that Portland has been in a bit of a slump as of late. Many people are pointing to the departure of LaMarcus Aldridge as the key reason for the team's poor performance this year. However, there could be other factors at play here.

Whatever the reason, it looks like people aren't betting on Portland this year! The Blazers are currently sitting at 6th in the Western Conference standings with a record of 33-37, and they don't seem to be gaining any ground. In fact, their odds of making it to the playoffs have actually decreased since the beginning of the season.

So what's causing all this trouble? Let's take a closer look at some of the main contributing factors.

## Losing LaMarcus Aldridge Was Huge

Of course, losing LaMarcus Aldridge was a huge blow to the team. He was their best player and one of the top forwards in the league. Not only was he an amazing scorer, but he was also a great rebounder and defender. Without him, Portland is struggling to find someone who can fill his shoes.

 Damian Lillard has been doing his best to carry the team, but he can only do so much by himself. Wesley Matthews and Nicolas Batum have also been putting up solid numbers, but they can't make up for everything that Aldridge brought to the table.

Portland is going to need some reinforcements if they want to make it past the first round of playoffs this year. Clearly, they lost way more than just one player when Aldridge left town.
