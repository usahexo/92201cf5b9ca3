#  John Updike's Paper for Baccarat Revealed

John Updike was a Pulitzer Prize winning American author who is known for his novels and short stories. In 1979, he published a book of nonfiction called "The Art of the Steal: How to Protect Yourself and Your Business from Fraud, Cheats, and Rogues." The book contains John's theory on how to play baccarat (an Italian casino game), which was originally published as a paper in 1978.

Updike's paper is concise and easy to understand, despite being written for an audience with no prior knowledge of the game. He begins by discussing the basic rules of baccarat, then goes on to explain his strategy for winning. Updike's approach is based on making smart bets and minimizing risks, rather than relying on chance alone.

One of the most interesting aspects of Updike's paper is his discussion of "the gambling instinct." He observes that many people are drawn to gambling because they enjoy the thrill of risk-taking, even if it means losing money in the long run. Updike argues that this instinct can be harnessed to improve one's chances of winning at baccarat.

Overall, Updike's paper provides a clear overview of how to play baccarat and win more often than not. While some of his tips may seem counterintuitive, they have been proven to work in practice. Anyone interested in learning this exciting casino game would do well to start with John Updike's seminal work.
