#  Import Hands from Multiple Poker Sites with Online Poker Tracker 4

Online Poker Tracker 4 (O.P.T. 4) is a comprehensive tracking and analysis software for Texas Hold’em cash games that allows users to import hands from multiple poker sites. O.P.T. 4 offers a variety of features and tools to help players improve their games, including detailed statistics on opponents’ playing styles, graphs and charts to visualize results, and customizable filters and reports.

One of the most powerful features of O.P.T. 4 is its ability to import hands from multiple poker sites into a single database for analysis. This allows players to track their progress over time and see how they perform against different types of opponents across different sites. O.P.T. 4 can automatically import hands from supported sites as soon as they become available, so there is no need to manually enter or export hands from different accounts.

To take advantage of this feature, first make sure that your poker site supports hand exports in the O.P.T 4 format (most do). Then open O.P.T 4 and click “ Tools > Options > Sites .” In the “Site 1” tab, select your preferred site from the “Import Site From” drop-down menu and enter your login credentials. Click “Save & Close” to save your changes.

Now switch to the “Hands” tab and select the site you want to import hands from in the “Import Site” drop-down menu at the top of the screen (default is set to your current site). The hands for that site will be imported into O.P.T 4 and will be accessible in all tabs (e.g., Statistics, Graphs, Reports, etc.).

Oftentimes when grinding away at a particular form of poker it is useful to be able to occasionally take a step back and view things in a more global sense; what better way than importing all data possible into one software? And OPT4 makes doing this about as painless as it could possibly be – we're not even talking about anything beyond clicking two buttons here people!
